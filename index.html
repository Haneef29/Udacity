                    I've just passed my first assignment (see attached). So far really loving this course so I just thought I'd keep a log of how its going in case I need to speak about it or if someone else in the team is interested in going through the course. The project is in a local git repo so you can go back to earlier revisions if needs be. <br> <br>

                    Part 1: HTML & CSS <br> <br>
                    
                    They do recommend having some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I'd say develop at least 5 different responsive sites because they only really cover the basics like how to start a web page, linking a stylesheet to your HTML page, the box model. <br> <br>
                    The biggest mistake I made the first submission was to not include the smaller CSS files in the main one and it took quite some time reworking the site into something that looked like my original idea. <br><br>
                    
                    There is a whole section grid and flex layouts which I enjoyed because I'm a bit more old school in that I primarily use floats and absolute poistioning, which they don't mention at all. <br><br>
                    
                    There are some topics that they left out which I feel would of been useful (especially for the first assignment) but I don't think they are being unfair in by not mentioning these: <br><br>
                    
                    Figma or any other design software - this is for wireframing and prototyping, there <br><br>
                    
                    Accessiblity - making sure its as easy for as many people as possible to use it <br><br><br>

                        The program itself is challenging, and i really like project oriented approach. <br><br>

                        First, i like the teaching style. Basics --> your own research --> project --> review if necessary. <br><br>
                        
                        Unlike many other courses, based only on videos, this program makes you read the documentation and search for answers yourself. I consider these 2 aspects to be very important for a programmer. <br><br>
                        
                        Being able to ask good questions is of extreme importance in any field of Development. This program teaches you to ask GOOD questions, to meet the required project specifications. <br><br>
                        
                        I want to mention the Udacity's GUI, it looks and feels amazing. <br><br>
                        
                        Overall, the program and TA's give us great value and experience. Worth it. <br><br><br>

                    <p>A couple of years ago I started a similar program through Coursera and I really enjoyed it so I was skeptical this would be any different. I was pleasantly proven wrong! I find this program to be a lot better for a self starter. It does not give you everything you need but does teach you were to find the answers you seek. Also I find myself needing supplemental resources to shore up my education. Which if not intentional is still a positive in my book. My only critique I think is how the JavaScript section really jumps into intermediate JavaScript. The bar is a tad too high and wish I had more of an introduction to JS prior to jumping straight into it.

                    Well explained and interesting Nanodegree Program! <br><br>

                    Unfortunately there is a buggy functionality of the input fields: Entering the quiz solution is cumbersome - you don't know exactly where the cursor is and you cannot easily enter changes in the field. <br><br>
                    
                    I take my editor, write the code there and then copy it into the input field. <br><br>
                    
                    Can you please fix this bug? Thanks! <br><br>
                    
                    The user setting for subtitle: It is a bit annoying that this cannot be set in general and that it has to be set up again for EVERY video... if you please could add this functionality in the settings too, like the language setting - it would be very nice! <br><br><br>

                <p> The program has really helped me to explore how much I enjoy programming. Also, the forums are like having peers work alongside you. I have found that they have even some of the same simple questions. And it’s a better source than going online and having to sort through Solutions that might be outdated. <br><br>

                    The reviewer feedback is helpful and always encouraging. <br><br>
                    
                    The best part I think it’s working at your own pace. This way you are able to absorb the material to the level of your satisfaction. <br><br>
                    
                    It’s a lot of work but I’m having fun. I highly recommend this program to motivated and determined developers. <br><br><br>

                    The best thing about this program is that you have real people reviewing your work or just helping you moving on. I found the initial part of the program (HTML and CSS) easier than I was expecting, maybe because it is an introduction and it might be good to refresh the knowledge. Nevertheless, the main focus on flexbox, grid and the mobile first approach made me feel very satisfied with the course. I do believe that A Web Developer must master these more complex structures in order to succeed.
